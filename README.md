🧠 About Me

I’m a CSE student at JECRC University (Kalvium SDE Program).

My goal is simple: become a strong engineer by building consistently instead of staying stuck in tutorials.

So far I’ve worked heavily on frontend development, built multiple projects, participated in hackathons, and started my DSA journey. Now I’m moving toward backend development, open source, and larger production-style projects.

Currently preparing to build a startup-scale project 🚀
